    <p>Hey Y'all!! This is a site for CV deca and just kinda an overview of what you can expect for competition and all that jazz!! It's a WIP so bear with me!! Also i made edits at home but i forgot to send it back to this computer so it's not as good :(
    <!-- <p>I know y'all must be confused as butt as to what's goin on with all this "DECA" nonsense
    <br />I for sure was
    <br />To start off with all this stuff, you should know there's 4 different categories for testing and roleplays
    <br />These categories also apply to the written events, but your roleplay DOESNT have to match your written event.
    <br />Choose what business u want to write about and then just do that event (but let's worry about that later)
    </p> -->

    <br /><div id="bm">
      Business Management and Administration,</div> which basically entails acting as a manager and dealing with customers

    <br /><div id="fin">
      Financing,</div> where you handle money and solve problems surrounding it. Last year, no one from CV did the principles roleplay for this so idk if it's an option for NorCal.

    <br /><div id="ht">
      Hospitality and Tourism,</div> which entails restaurants and hotels and travel and stuff. If you like hotels and solving problems with customers and don't know much about anything else, this is a good starting place.

    <br /><div id="mk">
      Marketing,</div> which is mostly selling, communications, research, and merchandising. (basically selling)

    <br /><center><h3>3 Different parts to COMPETITION!!!</h3></center><hr>
      <p><h4><div id=role>Step 1: Roleplays (best part imo)</div></h4>
      <br />there are so many different types of roleplays</p>

      <p>For first years, y'all can do <div id="prin"> PRINCIPLES!! </div>
      <br />Principles is all the basics of the 4 main topics, </p>
      <br />For more principles info and ways to study!! <a href="principles.html">principles :)</a>



    <p><h4>Step 2: Tests</h4></p>
    <p>Once u pick ur roleplay u get the test that goes with it</p>

    <p>Basically there's 5 tests:</p>

    <p>For First Years!!</p>

    <p><div id="prin">Business Admin Core (BAC):</p></div>
    <p>  for ALL the principle events regardless if it's not abt "Business"</p>

    <p>For Second+ Years!!!:</p>

    <p><div id="bm">Business Management Admin Exam:</p></div>
    <p>  if your event is yellow this is ur test</p>

    <p><div id="fin">Finance Exam:</p></div>
    <p>  if your event is green OR is financial consulting and NOT personal financial literacy</p>

    <p><div id="ht">Hospitality and Tourism Exam:</p></div>
    <p>  if your event is blue OR is hospitality and tourism prof selling</p>

    <p><div id="mk">Marketing Exam:</p></div>
